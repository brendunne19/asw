# asw

This is a space to keep track of particular projects and work that I have undertaken whilst on placement at AS Watson (ASW). 

## academies

The academies and `intro_to_git.md` were co-created or refreshed by the other [intern](https://github.com/q1any1tan) and myself to help new interns learn the ropes. If any mistakes are spotted please feel free to update them accordingly.

## showcases

The showcases are examples of work that I created during my year at ASW. Any credentials or details have been changed for security reasons, but the rest of the code remains unchanged.
